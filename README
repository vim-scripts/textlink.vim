This is (yet?) another way to implement hypertext styling linking in plain text files (a.k.a. source code).

The notation is extremely simple and easy to type (and comprehend at a glance): |FileName|@|SearchString| (even easier to understand at a glance with highlighting: see the Colors section of textlink.vim for details)

The format of a textlink is | filename to load_fullpath |@| text to search for |


Basically this is just :split FileName, gg, /SearchString. (ok very basically). You can omit loading of the file or searching for the SearchString if you like via the provided commands. You may also :vsplit if you like.


COMMANDS:
:TTL
    Mnemonic: test text link
    Test text link. (echos the found FileName and SearchString)

:TL
    Mnemonic: text link
    :split, :edit FileName, gg, /SearchString (basically). This is to say splits the current window and loads the specified file name then searches for the specified SearchString from the top of the file.

:TLF
    Mnemonic: text link file
    Like :TL save ignores the SearchString... basically a short cut to :split and gf

:TLS
    Mnemonic: text link string (or search)
    Like :TL save ignores the FileName... useful when FileName is |T|
    (this file) and you do not want to split the window.


:TTL
    Mnemonic: test text link
    Test text link. (echos the found FileName and SearchString)

:VTL
:VTLF
:VTLS
    Same as the above commands save :vsplit vs :split.


EXAMPLES:
|T|@|Examples:|
    This will search for 'Examples:' in this file (T for this). useful with either :TL or :TLS

|A|@|Examples:|
    This will search for 'Examples:' in the AlternateFile (A for alternate) from a.vim, see NOTE below. ? Wonderful for leaving notes about a function in a header file for instance.

|$VIM/vimfiles/plugin/textlink.vim|@|" Examples:|
    Environmental variables are expanded in the FileName portion, thanks to VIM :) In fact any(?) valid vim filename will work for FileName, I believe.

See: |~\cvs.html|@|if(somenum < 25 || somenum > 15)|, pretty cool eh?
    Although there can only be a single TextLink on any given line, it can appear anywhere in that line. (this is due to the greedy matching of the searchstring bars... to allow such a search string as this example..


NOTE
Please see the comments in the file for more information and stuffs.

Also this can (and is setup to) use a.vim by Mike Sharpe (http://vim.sourceforge.net/scripts/script.php?script_id=31)

This works well enough to use everyday (I do) however there are probably a few quirks in it yet. (we all know how that goes ;) )

I hope this is as useful to you as it is to me :)


Also of note (text hyperlinking) see  Stefan Bittner's http://vim.sourceforge.net/scripts/script.php?script_id=293


Happy VIMing!

Removed buggy/broken versions below, as there was no reason to use them (they were buggy!). I believe 1.32 is (finaly stable, sorry for all the bugs in the first place!)
