"
"	\brief		Easily load a file and search for a specified string. (handy
"				for notes in your code, etc.)
"				Invoke :TL on a line that contains something like, "|~\cvs.html|@|$EDITOR|"
"				or this... |T|@|Examples:| ... try it! :TL on this line!
"				You can also :TLS if you do not want to split (S for string)
"
"				Otherwise known as a text based hyperlink, or plain text
"				hyperlink (PTH)
"
"				This simply :splits the specified file, goes to the
"				top of said file, and seaches (down) for the specified text.
"				Ignoring the textlink's search text. (Basically)
"
"				[Feral:218/02@21:31] currently messes the jumplist up very
"					well. Soon as I figure out how to fix that I will.

"
" ChangeLog:
"	[Feral:241/02@21:25] Fixed one or two typos.
"	1.4
"	[Feral:215/02@23:42]
"	Should now accept absolute or full paths. Also, seems only one expansion
"		is possible (expand() fails if there are two env vars in FName for
"		instace)
"	[Feral:218/02@21:19]
"	You can now omit the T of for this file, i.e. || is valid and is the same
"		as |T|.
" {{{ Previous changes:
"
"	1.32
"	[Feral:212/02@14:04]
"	Cleaned up the color definitions and modified the help on what to do with
"		the textlink-fragment.vim file. Hopefully it will be easier to
"		understand what to do now if you've not messed with the syntax
"		highlighting much.
"
"	1.31
"	[Feral:210/02@14:25] fixed a !sigh! glaring bug. When the text link was
"	before the search string in the file it would break out prematurity.
"
"	1.3
"	[Feral:208/02@10:53] Added color definition entry in the help here (sort
"		of forgot it before) See: |T|@|Colors:| (:TLS this line)
"	Added :VTL :VTLS and :VTLF for vert splits instead of horiz splits.
"	Fixed a slight endless loop when the textlink was the only line with the
"	search string. Erm, oops.
"
"	1.2
"	[Feral:202/02@23:21] Well it's like this.. finding a textlink string in
"	another file would find the text link fine but broke out of the loop
"	before it went back to it. .. Changed logic of the while ~sigh~ knew I
"	should not have posted this after playing with it so reciently ~wink~
"
"	1.1
"	[Feral:202/02@12:34] Heh had just implimented searchstring method mark II
"	and just KNEW it was flawed. Heh much more confadent with MarkIII.
"	The problem was when there was more than one text link before the search
"	string we would always end up on the second textlink.
"	Fixed that by Changed the logic of finding the search string, seems fixed.
"	(only took 26 min too)
" }}}
"
" Usage:
"	Sun Jun 16  Pacific Daylight Time 2002 changed the pattern, more
"	recognisable as a text link now, yet basicaly the same.
"	New: blabber |FileName|@|SearchString| blabber
"	FileName can be:
"		|A|
"			to use AlternateFile (from a.vim) (see below)
"		|T| or ||
"			to use the current (T for this) file., i.e. split and search.
"
"		If FileName is not found, a new file is created. i.e. :e FileName
"
"
"	SearchString can be:
"		Any valid search string. Regular expressions are escaped and searched
"		for litteraly...
"
"	The SearchString is not allowed to be blank. basicaly only because a
"		textlink is not so meaningfull with out the searchstring.
"
" Commands:
"		:TTL
"			Test text link. (echos the found FileName and SearchString, and
"			path of the current file.)
"		:TL
"			:split FileName, gg, /SearchString (basically).
"			This is to say splits the current window and loads the specified
"				file name then searches for the specified SearchString from the
"				top of the file.
"			Effort is made to not match a textlink, and to load the `proper`
"				file.
"		:TLF
"			Like :TL save ignores the SearchString... basicaly a short cut to
"				:split
"			Consider ^wf (:h CTRL-W_f)
"		:TLS
"			Like :TL save ignores the FileName... usefull when FileName is |T|
"			(this file) and you do not want to split the window.
"		:VTL
"			Same as :TL but :vsplit instead of :split
"		:VTLF
"			Same as :TLF but :vsplit instead of :split
"		:VTLS
"			Same as :TLS but :vsplit instead of :split
"
"		I primarily use :TL and :TLS, fyi.

"	NOTE: textlink-fragment.vim is embeded in this file, see:
"		|T|@|textlink-fragment.vim:|
"
"	1) copy textlink-fragment.vim out of this file (it is embeded in this file
"		in the fold below, see |T|@|textlink-fragment.vim:| and just save that
"		fold to a new file called textlink-fragment.vim.
"
"	2) Place textlink-fragment.vim in your ~/.vim/syntax or
"		$VIM/vimfiles/syntax directory.
"
"	3) Goto your syntax directory (~/.vim/syntax or $VIM/vimfiles/syntax) and
"		choose which files you want textlink highlighting to appear in, i.e. c
"		files and say txt files. (as an example) (So for example the files we
"		want are: c.vim and txt.vim)
"
"	4) Add these three lines to the file(s), before comment groups i.e. BEFORE
"		the line that reads: "syn cluster	cCommentGroup	contains=" for c
"		files.: i.e. |$VIM/vimfiles/syntax/c-doxygen.vim|@|syn cluster	cCommentGroup	contains=|
"			" syntex coloring for textlinks.
"			source $VIM/vimfiles/syntax/textlink-fragment.vim
"			"source ~/.vim/syntax/textlink-fragment.vim
"
"		That will define feralTextLink, feralTextLinkC, feralTextLinkFNameC,
"			and feralTextLinkStringC. If you wish to have textlinks colored in
"			comments add feralTextLinkC to the commentgroup of your language
"			i.e. for c:
"			syn cluster	cCommentGroup	contains=cTodo,feralTextLinkC
"
"	5) (OPTIONAL) You may then (optinally but recommended) add color definitions for
"		feralTextLink, feralTextLinkC, feralTextLinkFNameC,
"		feralTextLinkStringC in your color file (located at ~/.vim colors/ or
"		$VIM/vimfiles/colors/)
"
"		Given the textlink: |Fname|@|Searchstring|
"
"		feralTextLink and feralTextLinkC being the color of the bars and at
"		sign: ||@||
"			feralTextLinkC is the contained version, what you will see in
"			comments or the like).
"
"		feralTextLinkFNameC for `Fname`
"
"		feralTextLinkStringC for `Searchstring`
"
"		For referance I went with this color scheme in my color.vim file. (for
"			GVIM):
"		hi feralTextLink		guifg=yellow2 guibg=SeaGreen gui=underline,bold
"		hi feralTextLinkC		guifg=yellow2 guibg=SeaGreen gui=underline,bold
"		hi feralTextLinkFName	guifg=wheat guibg=SeaGreen gui=underline
"		hi feralTextLinkString	guifg=Linen guibg=SeaGreen gui=underline

"
" Cautions:
"	There is not a huge amount of error checking (still needs if the file was
"	not found and if the search string was not found).. but works (great) for
"	me an I've never ran into a situation that prompted me to fix it.
"
"	Come to think of it not sure about a regular expression SearchString..
"	probably.
"
"	only one TextLink per line however any amount of text can be around it...
"	Mine are often in the middle of paragraphs... (descriping what needs to be
"	done next for example and textlink to that source file and line(well
"	search string).
"
" Examples:
"	// |~\cvs.html|@|$EDITOR|
"		load ~\cvs.html and search for the text `$EDITOR`.
"
"	// |A|@|if(somenum < 25 && somenum > 15)|
"		Load the alternate file (via a.vim) and search for "if(somenum < 25 && somenum > 15)"
"	// |A|@|if(somenum < 25 || somenum > 15)|
"		Load the alternate file (via a.vim) and search for "if(somenum < 25 || somenum > 15)"
"		Note that the search string contains | chars.. this is ok. (we use a
"		greedy match to make sure it is ok.)
"	// See: |~\cvs.html|@|if(somenum < 25 || somenum > 15)|, pretty cool eh?
"		Same as the above just with some text on either side.. the textlink
"		can appear anywhere on the line, ONLY ONE PER LINE however. (because
"		of the greedy match for | to allow the search string to have |s in
"		them, as mentioned below.
"
"	NOTE: you can use enviromental varables for the file name (basicaly any
"		valid vim file name I believe). Below, $KTBUGS is an enviromental var
"		that equates to a filename.
"
"	// \bug	See |$KTBUGS|@|BUG001| -- Some note about the bug
"		A useful example.. $KTBUGS is an enviromental var that expands to a
"		file name (full path) and BUG001 is just a unique identifier in the
"		(plain text) bug list.
"	// |$VIM/vimfiles/plugin/textlink.vim|@|" Examples:|
"		Combination enviromental var and file name, really handy when you make
"		an envvar out of a base path (your projects path for instance)
"
"		Similar to below in that the search string is in this file and BEFORE
"		this textlink.
"
"	// |T|@|Examples That Dont Work:|
"	// ||@|Examples That Dont Work:|
"		Similar to above in that the search string is in this file and AFTER
"		this textlink.
"
"	NOTE: you can use 'T' as the file name (or you may use a blank file name)
"		to use the existing file, basicaly just split and search for the
"		string. (!shrug! it was easy to do.. and quite handy as it turns out.)
"	// |T|@|Example: #3|
"	// ||@|Example: #3|
"
" Examples That Dont Work:
"	NOTE: you can use :TTL to echo the found filename and search string, handy
"		to see why your textlink isn't working like you think it should, and
"		for the examples below.
"	Example: #1	two text links on a line is invalid:
"	// |~\cvs.html|@|$EDITOR| blabber |!ALT!|@|if(somenum < 25 && somenum > 15)|
"	Example: #2	text after the text link that contains a bar '|':
"	// |~\cvs.html|@|$EDITOR| blabber and this too|
"	Example: #3	empty search string (kind of pointless ;) )
"	// |~\cvs.html|@||
"	This may be allowed in a future version. and just well, not search for
"		anything. /shrug
"	NOTE:
"	Both of cases #1 and #2 are rather unavoidable, I think, because of the
"	desire of wanting to allow a logical or '||' in the search string so we
"	use a gready match. (minimal match would stop at the first '|') ..
"	alternativly use a different seperator char other than bar. Frankly I
"	didn't find one I liked and I can live with the above limitations.
"
" Note:
"	Note that you can place enviromental vars ($ENVVAR notation, standard vim)
"	as the, or in the file name portion. This can be handy for often used
"	files (a TODO list or BUG list, or some such.)
"	Note that a file name of `A` requires `AlternateFile` in a.vim by Michael Sharpe
"		<feline@irendi.com> (http://vim.sourceforge.net/scripts/script.php?script_id=31),
"		and will (slickly) use the alternate file (as defined by/in a.vim).
" Redundant Format Explination:
"	There are two strings (enclosed by '|' chars) of interest in a line, the first
"	is the file name to load, the second is the string to search for in file name.
"	These '|' delimited strings are joined by a '@' char, so the pattern looks like
"	|word|@|word|.
" Known Bugs:
"	No error checking for if the filename was loaded properly.
"	The search string is escaped.., althought perhaps not everything that
"		should be escaped is being escaped.
"		See: |T|@|_TL_EscapedString_defined_here_|
"		See: ||@|_TL_EscapedString_defined_here_|
